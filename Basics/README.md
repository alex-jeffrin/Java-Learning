## 1. classes 
  classes in other words are used defined data types. it also has its own default constructor.those constructors can also me overriden. class has varible declared it will be called as instance varable when an object is created.

## 2. General form of class :
 classes have the following syntax to declare 

 ```java 
 Classname objectname = new classname();
 ```
 it can also be written as 

```java 
 Classname objectname ;
 objectname = new Classname();
```
first it create a reference of class as a type and initially it will be null. and while executing the second statement it creates a dynamic memory in heap memory and the address of the memory is stored in that variable.


The structure of the class will be as follow 

```java
class classname {
  datatype instance-variable1 ;
  datatype instance-variable2 ;

  type method(){
    //Statement to execute
  }

  access_specifier type method(parameter){
    //Statement to execute
  }
}
```
